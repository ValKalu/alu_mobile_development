Submit a max 3min video demo of your prototype

Link to your prototype , here is my email in case you have to give me permission ekarambizi@alueducation.com.

 

You will work in the same groups that you worked with in Assignment1.

Follow the instructions on week 2 tutorial ( your first app with dart and flutter, this one you do not have to submit , but will be useful for our class session).

 

Your app must have :

Sign in and Sign up

Serves multiple users 

gets data (information) from the user.

uses an API ( eg: google maps, or any other API of your choice)

Has at least 5 screens

give the user some kind of feedback depending on entered data ( analytics, score,...)

 

Your app can be a game if you want to go that route.
